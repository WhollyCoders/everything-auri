          I don't know where to start...
          I know what I like to do but...
          I like to draw, sew, paint, and bake...
          I like to sketch but sometimes it doesn't have to be
           something in particular, it is just something that I make up in
           my head.

           I am a person who likes to eat. I think I like to eat
            because food is delicious. I think I was made to be creative.

            Not only do I have a desire to exercise my creativity, I also
            feel compelled to do things that stretch my creative side.

            I enjoy sewing and had the privledge of creating several pieces
            with the help of different classes and mentors, but
             I am hoping to create my own original clothing without
             assistance in the future. I have created different
             accessories in the past without patterns, and I am anticipating
             doing the same with clothing.
